## About this Tutorial

 The field of quantum computing is rapidly advancing, and one of the most pressing challenges is the mitigation of errors that can arise during the computation process. This tutorial delves into the concepts of error suppression and error mitigation in quantum computing using Qiskit Runtime Primivites. It begins with an overview of the various sources of errors that can impact quantum computations, followed by a detailed explanation of how to identify and mitigate these errors using proven techniques. The tutorial concludes by demonstrating the effectiveness of error mitigation and error suppression by using Qiskit Runtime Primitives in production. By the end of this tutorial, readers will have a foundational understanding of how to suppress and mitigate errors in order to extract the best results from todayâ€™s quantum hardware.
